# ‚ö° rx-js-light

This library provides tools to generate and consume blazing fast Observables and Observers.

However, it is not RxJS: **it's faster, smaller, and tries to be simpler.** Give it a try, and you'll love it !  
Because it's extremely light and performant, you may include it even in your smallest projects.


[<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-tutorial-brightgreen?style=for-the-badge" />](src/examples/tutorial.md)


If you're not familiar with the concept of Observables you may
check [the rxjs documentation](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/guide/observable), or
[this excellent tutorial](https://gist.github.com/staltz/868e7e9bc2a7b8c1f754)

The main purpose of Observables is to **react to changes**.

**If anything in your app happens asynchronously, there is a high chance that an Observable will make that easier for you.**

*Example:*

```js
const subscription = new Subscription(
  fromEventTarget(window, 'mousemove'),
  (event) => {
    console.log(event.clientX, event.clientY);
  },
);

const subscribe = fromEventTarget(window, 'click');

subscribe(() => {
  subscription.toggle();
});
```

This example displays the mouse position, with an *activate / deactivate* mechanism when we click.

Differences with RxJS:

- no classes: this choice allows blazing fast performances and very small bundle size. Indeed, creating a class with
  the `new` keyword is slow, and method names can't be mangled (minimized), where function calls are really well
  optimized by javascript engines. However, it has a minor cost: chaining operators or method calls are done through
  functions, which is a little less elegant (in terms of code readability).

- no `next`, `complete` and `error`: instead this lib use [notifications](src/misc/notifications/notifications.md).
  In reality, not all *Observables* require to emit a final state. For example, the RxJS `interval`
  never reaches a `complete` state. It just sends numbers. Moreover, some *Observables* may want to emit more
  than this 3 *events*: we may imagine an XHR
  Observable which emits an `upload-progress` and `download-progress` *events*.

- some concepts / operators / methods may have a different behaviour or name.
  Take care to read the documentation before any hasty use.
  

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
yarn add @lifaon/rx-js-light
# or
npm install @lifaon/rx-js-light --save
```

This library supports:

- **common-js** (require): transpiled as es5, with .cjs extension, useful for old nodejs versions
- **module** (esm import): transpiled as esnext, with .mjs extension (requires node resolution for external packages)

In a **node** environment the library works immediately (no extra tooling required),
however, in a **browser** environment, you'll need to resolve external imports thought a bundler like
[snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/),
[rollup](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/),
[webpack](https://webpack.js.org/),
etc...
or directly using [skypack](https://www.skypack.dev/):
[https://cdn.skypack.dev/@lifaon/rx-js-light](https://cdn.skypack.dev/@lifaon/rx-js-light)

**INFO:** you won't be able to directly measure the size of this library
(ex: [bundlephobia](https://bundlephobia.com/)) as it has been optimized for tree-shacking and minification.
No bundle is shipped with this lib: this ensures you properly optimize your project.
If you only use typings, the lib will be 0 bytes, if you use only one function, only this one will be included, etc...
So the size of this library will always be optimal. [You may find an example here](src/examples/example03.md)
